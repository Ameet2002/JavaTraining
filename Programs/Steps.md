Java Programs - Hands On
========================
1. Set Environment variable for Java (`java`, `javac`). 
	Refer : `setJavaPath.bat` file 

2. Compile and Execute a `HelloWorld.java` Program

3. Practice Programs for using the data types
	`Factorial.java`
	`CheckPrime.java`
	Assignment: Write a Program to list all the Prime Numbers from 1 to 30.
		Different check points : 
			1. Print each number - with the status (Number i is Prime/Not Prime).
			2. Print ONLY the prime numbers - using an Array - using the Array Length 
			3. Observe the gaps and use a counter to loop through the Array and avoid the zero elements.
	`StringLength.java`
	`StringPalindromeCheck.java`

4. Program to convert an input from String to different data types. Integer, Float, Boolean.
	Assignment: Try the same for Byte, Short and Double datatypes. 

4. Program to pass the input from Command Line Argument

5. Program to get the input from Console

6. Practice Programs with Methods for reusability
	`FactorialArg.java`
	`CheckPrimeArg.java`
	`StringLengthArg.java`
	`StringPalindromeCheckArg.java`

7. Execute a Student Class, with the `main()` method.

8. Execute a Student class and a TestStudent class. 
	Student.java will contain only the Student Attributes and Behaviors
	TestStudent.java will contain the `main()` method

9. OOP - `Person.java`, `Student.java` 
	Encapsulation
	Polymorphism
	Inheritance
